# movie_text_processing
This was a college project I did making a neural network to train on IMBD movie reviews
Was done with colaboration with two classmates of mine: EQ and Kendahl Cameau at Whitworth University
At the end this model was not sucessful because i had not released that you cant assgin simple integer values to a word and then run that through a neural network, so while in the end this project was a failure, i learned a lot about making neural nets, the math behined it along with the implenmation of it and some of the tricker points of where it could be more diffuclt and learn about vector representation of words by the end of the project once id released my mistake
